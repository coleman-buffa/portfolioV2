# Portfolio Version 2

Welcome to the second edition of my portfolio showcasing the web development skills I have learned so far. I wanted to build a portfolio site that was responsive, mobile-first design, and easy to read. I prefer designs that are straight forward and direct, and tried to build this site with that in mind. I also wanted to try a new CSS framework and decided on Zurb's Foundation. The assignments included in the portfolio demonstrate the following noteworthy skills:

* HTML/CSS
* Javascript and JQuery
* Responsive design
* CSS Frameworks
* Local Storage
* AJAX and third party APIs
* Project planning and working in a team setting
